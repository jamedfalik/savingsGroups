            <h2>The Power of Self-Capitalization</h2>
            <p class="opening">Savings groups are community-based financial mechanisms that provide members a secure place to save, the opportunity to borrow on appropriate terms, and affordable basic insurance services. Savings groups—self-capitalized, member-managed, transparent, rule-governed, ethical, and complementary to other financial services—can play an important role in the lives of various populations, particularly rural households, women, or other disadvantaged groups, such as those affected by HIV/AIDS. Savings groups increase financial capabilities, assets, social security, and control over one’s own life.</p>

        <h1>DAI acts as a market facilitator</h1>
        <p>DAI works with local and international savings group facilitators to improve efficiency, increase outreach, integrate new technology, and reduce cost of savings group expansion and replication.</p>

          <p>DAI’s savings group work has had an important impact in Africa, where innovation is being driven and tested for savings group efficiency and expansion. In Ethiopia, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia, DAI works with local and international organizations to improve the quality and reach of savings groups, incorporating technology for group training and record keeping in some cases.</p>

        <h1>DAI is committed to innovation <br> and learning</h1>
        <p>Over the past two decades, DAI has contributed to groundbreaking thought leadership—documenting early experiences with savings groups in the 1990s, for example, and to more recently conducting state-of-the-art project evaluations in Kenya and Tanzania with NGOs, government, and donors, particularly the U.K. Department for International Development’s Financial Sector Deepening Trusts.</p>

          <p>In Tanzania, under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Economic Strengthening for Households Affected by AIDS project, DAI conducted a survey of 1,200 households that demonstrated impressive results of its use of savings groups as a development and livelihoods tool for caregivers of HIV+ family members or vulnerable children and people living with or affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>
